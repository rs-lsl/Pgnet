**UPDATE: We have open source the real ziyuan hyperspectral datasets used in this paper to contribute the hyperspectral image fusion field.**

Please see details about the datasets in: https://github.com/rs-lsl/CSSNet

Pytorch implement of 'Unmixing based PAN guided fusion network for hyperspectral imagery'(TGRS)

Please change the HSI dataset and SRF path and run the 'main_all.py' to train the model.

**The JiaXing dataset used in this work could be available at "https://aistudio.baidu.com/aistudio/datasetdetail/124050"**

We also release the code in paddle version if you use paddle framework in research. "https://aistudio.baidu.com/aistudio/projectdetail/3383847". 

Please kindly cite this paper if you find the dataset and code useful. 

If you have any suggestions or questions, please dont hesitate to contact the author: 'cug_lsl@cug.edu.cn'.
